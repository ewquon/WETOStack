<p>Wind energy researchers typically share one key characteristic: a passion for increasing
wind energy in the global energy mix. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) supports this mission
in a number of ways including allocating funding directly to various aspects of wind energy
research through the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/office-energy-efficiency-renewable-energy">Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)</a>
via the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/wind-energy-technologies-office">Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)</a>.
While the traditional output of research is academic publication, software development efforts
are increasingly a major focus. Software tools in the research environment allow researchers to
describe an idea and quickly increase the scope and scale. As a product of research, these tools
represent a direct pipeline from researcher to industry practitioners since they implementation
of ideas described in academic publications. Given this vital role in wind energy research and
commercial development, the broad research software portfolio supported by WETO must maintain a
minimum level of quality to support the wind energy field in the growing transition to
renewable energy. <strong>This report outlines a series of best practices to be adopted by all
WETO-supported software projects, as well as expectations that the communities interacting with
these projects should have of the developers and tools themselves.</strong></p>
<!-- EERE Mission:
EERE’s mission is to accelerate the research, development, demonstration, and deployment of
technologies and solutions to equitably transition America to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions
economy-wide by no later than 2050, and ensure the clean energy economy benefits all Americans,
creating good paying jobs for the American people—especially workers and communities impacted
by the energy transition and those historically underserved by the energy system and
overburdened by pollution. -->
<!-- General idea to community here: -->
<!-- WETO Software is critical. -->
<!-- It is **the** mechanism to put the ideas behind WETO research into the hands of practitioners. -->
<!-- It should be accessible to students, researchers, practitioners within wind energy as well as engineers and scientists from adjacent fields. -->
<!-- While each tool or project has a finite life span, the WETO Software Portfolio will exist as long as WETO itself exists. -->
<!-- This collection of software truly is the foundation of innovation in wind energy research. -->
<p>Wind energy research software has a unique standing in the field of scientific software. The
stakeholders are varied with a subset being:</p>
<!-- Venn diagram funders / programmatic interests, developers, users -->
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DOE EERE leadership</p></li>
<li><p>DOE WETO leadership and program managers</p></li>
<li><p>National lab leadership</p></li>
<li><p>Associated project principle investigators</p></li>
<li><p>Research software engineers</p></li>
<li><p>Wind energy researchers in academia
(including graduate students, post docs, and national lab staff)</p></li>
<li><p>Industry researchers and practitioners</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial software developers</p></li>
<li><p>The general public interested in wind energy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These software are typically the end-user of other generic software libraries, so
the funding cycles are often tied to applied research rather than the development of the
software itself. Since the developers are also wind energy researchers, these tools are
typically designed in a way that closely resembles the application in which they’re used.
Additionally, the expertise and incentives for the developers have a high variability, and
often neither are aligned with software engineering or computer science.</p>
<p>Given the unique environment in which wind energy research software is produced and consumed,
it is critical for model owners to understand the context of their software. A framework
for developing this understanding is to answer the following questions of a given software project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is it’s purpose?</p></li>
<li><p>What is it’s role in the field of wind energy?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the profile of the expected users?</p></li>
<li><p>For how long will it be relevant?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the expected impact?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These questions allow model owners to identify the appropriate methods for the design, development,
and long term maintenance of their software. Additionally, the answer provide context for future
planners to understand why particular decisions were made and discern the consequences of
changing course.</p>
<p>The best practices outlined in this report are concerned with software quality and are organized
into the following sections:</p>

groups as well as external organizations and efforts to define the craft of research software
engineering. These best practices aim to make the collaborative development process efficient
and effective while improving the model understanding across stakeholders. Additionally,
the general adoption of a common framework for software quality ensures that the end users
of WETO software can trust these tools and accurately understand the risks to workflow integration.</p>

<p>Using a computer in a scientific context is a learned skill and requires years of practice to
become proficient. Tools like a “terminal”, “shell”, or “command prompt” are not initially
intuitive, and that these three terms are used interchangeably can lead to further confusion.
This is an example of a barrier to entry often encountered by early-career researchers and
experienced practitioners alike. In order to improve accessibility, it is important to
understand the experience of users and design software to meet their needs.</p>
<p><strong>BP: Identify target user profiles and anticipate their levels of understanding. Accurately
understand the complexity of the systems used to access the software, and evaluate whether
this matches the expected skills in target users.</strong></p>
<p>Some examples of common barriers to entry are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Navigating a “terminal”</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge of acronyms, jargon, or interchangeable phrases</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CLI, API, IDE, etc</p></li>

<p>Research computing software often depend on third-party libraries, and many of these dependencies
are research software themselves. Therefore, the installation and environment configuration
for this type of software can easily become complex.</p>
<p><strong>BP: It is the responsibility of developers to provide a streamlined method of installation using
common software distribution systems and automation as much as practical.</strong></p>
<p>Mature package managers are a great resource since they have a distribution system already in place
and manage dependencies between software tools.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of open source software package managers has coalesced around a few primary tools:</p>

<p>The process for including a package in a package management system varies, but all are designed
to integrate with automated systems to prepare and distribute the package automatically upon
a given event. The practice of releasing a software package after a tagged release
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#version-control"><span class="std std-ref">Version control</span></a>) or requisite set of changes is called “continuous integration”,
also known as “CI”. Tools for this level of automatic are common, and a practical choice
is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. A typical CI pipeline for a Python
package is shown below where the square components are GitHub Actions steps. Note that this
pipeline includes sub-system areas called “Continuous Testing” and “Continuous Deployment”.</p>

<p>Usability is concerned with how practitioners are expected to execute the software including
creating inputs and managing outputs.</p>
<p>Nuances of research software:
- “Design” is typically not a consideration at all
- It is typical to adopt “patterns”, so there is very little evolution of software interface design and therefore usability
- Research software is expected to be predictable and similar to what users already know. The challenge is to understand the existing paradigms and adopt them well.</p>
<section id="user-interface">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" role="doc-backlink">User interface</a><a class="headerlink" href="#user-interface" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The user interface (UI) is any mechanism through which users interact with the software
typically by providing inputs and receiving outputs. Examples of UI’s include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Graphical user interface (GUI)</p></li>
<li><p>Web-based front ends</p></li>
<li><p>Input and output files</p></li>
<li><p>Command line interface</p></li>
<li><p>Library API’s</p></li>
</ul>
<p>WETO software UI’s should be well defined and predictable.
They should adopt the conventions that already exist in the environments and contexts
in which they’re used.
Most importantly, all user interfaces should be well documented.</p>
<section id="command-line-interface">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14" role="doc-backlink">Command line interface</a><a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-interface" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The command line interface (CLI) is one type of front-end for software.
It is the method by which a software is executed via a computer’s terminal.
WETO software should in general adhere to the following conventions and principles for CLI’s.
However, these are guidelines and can be skipped when context is clear or another
option improves usability.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Adopt command line syntax requirements from <a class="reference external" href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guideline 1: Utility names should be between two and nine characters, inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 2: Utility names should include lowercase letters (the lower character classification) and digits only from the portable character set.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 3: Each option name should be a single alphanumeric character (the alnum character classification) from the portable character set. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-W</span></code> (capital-W) option shall be reserved for vendor options. Multi-digit options should not be allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 4: All options should be preceded by the `-`` delimiter character.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 5: One or more options without option-arguments, followed by at most one option that takes an option-argument, should be accepted when grouped behind one <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> delimiter.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 6: Each option and option-argument should be a separate argument, except as noted in <a class="reference external" href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html">Utility Argument Syntax, item (2)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 7: Option-arguments should not be optional.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 8: When multiple option-arguments are specified to follow a single option, they should be presented as a single argument, using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;comma&gt;</span></code> characters within that argument or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;blank&gt;</span></code> characters within that argument to separate them.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 9: All options should precede operands on the command line.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 10: The first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--</span></code> argument that is not an option-argument should be accepted as a delimiter indicating the end of options. Any following arguments should be treated as operands, even if they begin with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> character.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 11: The order of different options relative to one another should not matter, unless the options are documented as mutually-exclusive and such an option is documented to override any incompatible options preceding it. If an option that has option-arguments is repeated, the option and option-argument combinations should be interpreted in the order specified on the command line.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 12: The order of operands may matter and position-related interpretations should be determined on a utility-specific basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 13: For utilities that use operands to represent files to be opened for either reading or writing, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> operand should be used to mean only standard input (or standard output when it is clear from context that an output file is being specified) or a file named “-“.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline 14: If an argument can be identified according to Guidelines 3 through 10 as an option, or as a group of options without option-arguments behind one <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> delimiter, then it should be treated as such.</p></li>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15" role="doc-backlink">Input and output files</a><a class="headerlink" href="#input-and-output-files" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The ecosystem of tools for processing data files is vast and mature.
Therefore, input and output files should adopt a common file type and syntax relevant to the
field and context of the software itself.
For example, large datasets generated by computational fluid dynamics software are often
exported in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/">HDF5</a> format since robust
libraries are available to export the data and load it into post-processing tools.
Similarly, input files should retain a ubiquitous human-readable format such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a> as this allows users to generate input files programmatically
using standard libraries. Input and output files required by WETO software should
adhere to the following conventions and principles.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simple, clear, and predictable structure</p></li>
<li><p>Expressive and concise</p></li>

<p>Messaging to practioners from within a software can be immensely helpful.
At the same time, the infrastructure for communicating messages can be a heavy lift.
It is important to find a balance of appropriate levels of messaging while also ensuring that

Too much messaging results in information overload and critical messages can be lost in noise.

and general maintenance and infrastructure upgrades can be introduced with minimal overhead.</p>
<!-- TODO: strengthen this intro. The point is that maintenance is key to the life of WETO software.

<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Grok</em> means “to understand”, of course, but Dr. Mahmoud, who might be termed the leading
Terran expert on Martians, explains that it also means, “to drink” and “a hundred other
English words, words which we think of as antithetical concepts. ‘Grok’ means <em>all</em> of
these. It means ‘fear’, it means ‘love’, it means ‘hate’ – proper hate, for by the Martian
‘map’ you cannot hate anything unless you grok it, understand it so thoroughly that you
merge with it and it merges with you – then you can hate it. By hating yourself. But this
implies that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise. Then you
can <em>hate</em> – and (I think) Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human
equivalent could only be called mild distaste.</p>

<p>That such a word exists and is widely used in software development illustrates the high value
of clear and understandable code.
WETO software should avoid complexity where possible and favor readability over writability.
Strive to create software that can be easily grokked by developers who do not have the current
context.</p>
<p>The designers of the Python programming language consider readability as a primary priority, and
the most famous of the many Python language-development documents is
<a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> which proposes a style guide for Python code.
PEP 8 is summarized into 19 aphorisms (20 including one that’s implied) and is referred to as
<a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">“The Zen of Python”</a>. Much of the WETO software portfolio is
Python-based, so these guiding principles directly apply. However, these principles are
programming language agnostic and eloquently describe the paradigm for developing
extendable software.</p>

<p>Version control, typically with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code>, is a tool for tracking the evolution of a project change
by change establishing a history of changes.
Each change is itself a version of the software, and they provide a snapshot of thought
processes and progression of work.</p>
<p>BP: Craft a version control history that communicates the evolution of changes of the software
to future developers including the author of current changes.
BP: Evolve the software in a logical, linear process with digestible change sizes.</p>
<p>Version control with git is often a secondary consideration in the software development process.
It can seem like simply a mechanism to “save” the state of a document.
However, it carries far more meaning in the context of software extendability.
Since the git system is decentralized, it allows for multiple developers to make changes to a
project concurrently.
Git also provides a mechanism for resolving differences so that multiple changes can be merged
together easily.</p>
<p>In addition to the content of changes themselves, the connectivity between changes is valuable
over the lifetime of a project.
The connectivity between commits is structured as a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclical graph (DAG)</a>.
Each commit has a parent and each parent can have multiple children.
This provides a mechanism for easily and accurately rolling back to the state of the project at any
time in history.</p>
<p>To best leverage the power of git to enable extendability, consider the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is reasonable to spend time crafting each commit and a sequence of commits.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice editing a series of commits to ensure that the progress of work is captured accurately.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider whether the commit history is concise and readable to people who are not the authors.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Interactive rebase</p></li>
<li><p>Cherry-pick</p></li>
<li><p>Squash</p></li>
<li><p>Edit a commit message</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Commit messages should be short, and it is a convention to limit them less than 50 characters.</p></li>
<li><p>An additional line can be included as a longer description of the commit beneath the
50 character line. The second line is typically limited to 70 characters, but it is
considered reasonable to use as much space as needed.</p></li>

<p>The processes through which developers interact with a software and other developers is
an essential component of extendability.
These processes should generally strive for efficiency while minimizing overhead.
Automated processes are better than manual processes, and objective is better than subjective.
The majority of collaborative software development processes occur on cloud-based resources on
the GitHub platform.</p>
<p><strong>BP: Plan and coordinate software development efforts into a collaborative workflow using GitHub</strong></p>
<p><strong>BP: Automate code quality feedback as much as possible via GitHub Actions</strong></p>
<p>GitHub contains some key features for coordinating software development:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Issue tracking</p></li>
<li><p>Forum-style discussions</p></li>
<li><p>Pull request and code review</p></li>
<li><p>Project boards</p></li>
<li><p>Releases</p></li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub and git (see <a class="reference internal" href="#version-control"><span class="std std-ref">Version control</span></a>) are tightly connected, but they are different
systems and serve different purposes in the development process.
Git is a version control system for tracking and merging changes to a software.
GitHub is a platform for orchestrating and coordinating the various processes that happen
around the development cycle.
GitHub activities add context on top of the individual changes captured in commits.
Whereas commits often capture low-level information, GitHub activities can map the low level
details to high-level efforts.</p>
<p>Become familiar with GitHub features and leverage them to plan and communicate.</p>
<!-- TODO Include a link to resources to learn about GitHub -->
<p>GitHub features can be used a many ways. The primary features are described below and a typical
sequence of events across these features is described.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions">Discussions</a>: This is typically the starting point
for any collaboration. Create a discussion topic and engage with other model stakeholders
to define the idea and develop a proposed implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues">Issues</a>:
Document the proposed solution to a problem or implementation of a new feature as outlined
in the corresponding Discussion. Finalize the description and outline test cases to verify
the idea.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">Projects</a>:
Collect Issues, Pull Requests, and generic cards to establish a relationship across all
ongoing works in progress. This is typically most useful for large development efforts
and prioritizing work for upcoming releases.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">Pull Requests</a>:
Pull Requests (PR) are a request to accept a change into a branch. This typically happens
across forks of a repository, but it can also happen between branches of the same fork.
During the implementation of an Issue, open a pull request to communicate that work is
ongoing. This is also the venue for code reviews.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases">Releases</a>:
A number of accepted pull requests can be aggregated to comprise one release, and this is
listed in a project’s GitHub Releases page along with release notes to describe the changes
and communicate relevant details.</p></li>

        </div><p>Along with git, GitHub provides a helpful mechanism to capture design intent, factors that lead
to particular decisions, and the evolution of a project for future reference.
However, it is important carefully craft the messages to avoid washing out information
with noise.
The following are guidelines to consider when engaging on GitHub.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Descriptions of any activity should be well scoped and easily understandable.</p></li>
<li><p>Pictures really are worth 1,000 words. Always include a diagram, plot, screenshot, or picture
when it will add clarity.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer actual text over of screenshots of text. GitHub is searchable, so text provides more
searchable context whereas screenshots do not. Additionally, text-based code snippets can be
copied easily by other users.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a practice of assigning responsibility for each Issue and Pull Request. Without
a person to take ownership, these will remain unaddressed.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pull-requests">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23" role="doc-backlink">Pull Requests</a><a class="headerlink" href="#pull-requests" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A pull request is a request to merge a particular set of code changes into another copy of the
software, typically an agreed upon “main” version.</p>
<p>Pull requests should include contextual information regarding the code change. The intention is
to convince reviewers and maintainers that the new code is in a good state and that it’s
inclusion would be a benefit to the project. This typically involves a contextual description of
the change and a description of why the change is valid and well tested.</p>
<p>Futhermore, GitHub automatically constructs release notes from all of the pull requests merged
since the previous release.
It automatically takes the titles of each pull request to construct the release notes.
“Update XYZ” again provides no context and more work is required to communicate what has changed
to users and downstream dependencies.</p>
<p>All version control messages (commits and pull requests) should communicate what the change
accomplishes.
Vague messages such as “updated solver” are distracting and lack meaning.
Consider the following two pull request messages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Update turbine ontology”</p></li>
<li><p>“NatSpec: Fix duplicated display of the data type in NatSpec <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">///</span> <span class="pre">&#64;return</span></code> comments”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first message vaguely indicates an “update” while the second clearly states what is changed.
The first message provides n detail around what is updated or why it matters while the second
indicates there was a problem that is now fixed.
The additional description in the first provides more info that could have been incorporated into
the title.
Even though domain specific context is required to understand both of these pull requests, the
second implicitly communicates much more information in just a few words.
The outcome is that readers of the commit history in the second repository can quickly scan the
commit history and understand the evolution of changes simply from the commit messages.
The first repository requires opening individual changes to understand their scope and context.</p>

<span id="sustainability"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24" role="doc-backlink">Long term sustainability</a><a class="headerlink" href="#long-term-sustainability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The long term sustainability of software is directly related to the level of infrastructure and
tooling around the code to characterize its design, behavior and performance. This infrastructure
is typically automated through services like GitHub, and it is targeted at developers in two
different categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Maintainers</strong> who will keep the infrastructure running, update dependency versions and API’s,
and address bugs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extenders</strong> who will periodically return to the software to add new features</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Nuances of research software:
- The landscape is broad and the associated ecosystem changes very quickly but adoption is very slow
- iOS for example runs on a small set of well-known hardware</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Research funding cycles do not include maintenance</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The maintenance component of sustainability deals with ensuring that, even with no changes
internally, the software can continue to function with changes that happen externally.
This can involve updates to the software to support new operating systems, virtual machines,
runtime environments, and hardware components. A recent example is the introduction of Apple
computers with Arm-based CPU’s rather than the canonical x86 architecture. This change prompted
a slew of upgrades to the entire ecosystem of software from compilers and interpreters to
debuggers and profilers.</p>
<p>The extension component ensures that developers who work to add new features and improvements are
able to determine whether their change had the intended effect and no side effects.</p>

<p>Research software exists in a unique environment.
The breadth of experience in users and developers is more narrow than in other types of software,
and the funding mechanisms are often tied to results from using the software rather than
to the software tools themselves.
Because of these nuances of the research software environment, the incentives to create high
quality software are often lacking, and this can leave software developers with the difficult
choice of choosing to prioritize with their work or career but not both.
Therefore, it is important to directly consider the needs and expectations of the people
responsible for designing and implementing research software projects.</p>
<p>The term research software engineer (RSE) is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Research Software Engineer (RSE) combines professional software engineering expertise with
an intimate understanding of research.
<a class="reference external" href="https://society-rse.org/about/">https://society-rse.org/about/</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>While modern research typically involves using research software, it is common for research
software engineers to focus skill development on either the research domain or the aspects
related to software engineering.
Additionally, the research environment in academia and government research labs are structured
to incentivize academic publication.
Therefore, the resulting teams are often comprised of domain researchers and research software
engineers.
The domain researchers inform the needs of the research software and are the primary users.
The RSE’s design and develop the software systems as well as manage various IT responsibilities
for the group such as creating computer-based workflows, managing data, constructing web-based
research artifacts, and training colleagues on best practices in research computing.</p>
<p>In this context, note the difference between computer science and software engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Computer science</strong> is the study of computation, information, and automation.
Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation,
and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of
hardware and software).
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software engineering</strong> is an engineering-based approach to software development. A software
engineer is a person who applies the engineering design process to design, develop, maintain,
test, and evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym,
but may emphasize software implementation over design and can also lack connotations of
engineering education or skills.</p>
<p>Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process, which involves the
definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of
the software life cycle process itself.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat a RSE as an engineer</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Many have engineering or science degrees and treat their work as engineering.</strong>
Don’t refer to them as “programmers” doing “programming”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing code and designing software systems are entirely different things, and the latter must be recognized relative to the value that it adds.</strong>
Software design and software architecture are very complicated, and the process of developing
a design given various requirements is a design process. It involves stating requirements,
iterative design, and validation and verification of the design. It often takes years to fully
accomplish an objective and at the same time the landscape of computers and software
development is changing. Additionally, software is rarely created by one person, so the RSE
has to deal with managing multiple people making changes simultaneously while also trying to
meet the needs of the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to acknowledgement of work and value added, it is important to provide meaningful
career guidance to RSE’s to serve both the personal goals of associated staff and ensure
that the projects have well-rounded contributors. RSE’s should have some level of domain
experience; that is to say that they should <em>use</em> as well as <em>develop</em> their software.
RSE’s should know the context in which their software exists.
They should be experts in the implementation and very good in the usage.
A typical career trajectory within the national lab environment look something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Year 1: Implementing models and developing tests and documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Year 2: Second author on analyses, improved modeling, informing AOP, and writing developer-specific documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Year 3: Lead author on analysis work, guiding the direction for future development projects, writing AOP, writing user-specific documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Year 4: Proposing new work and seeking funding to expand the software project</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the amount of code written by a developer should peak around year 2 or 3 and
then start to drop.
It should not go to 0, but the majority of involvement in software development should be code
review, design, and project planning.</p>
<!-- ## Ideas


**Optimize for readability not writability.**
Don't assume your code makes sense to everybody else. Use natural language to express ideas in
the documentation and code comments. As much as possible, write your code so that it reads close
to natural language. Language semantics and performance considerations can be in contrast to
this, so it is up to the developer to find the right balance of expression of intent and
achievement of the requirements of the code.

Consider how users and developers will be able to come up to speed.
- Are algorithms documented in words and graphics?

How are design intents communicated?
- These things should not live in someone's head. In that case, they're as good as gone.
It only exists if it has been written down.

Documentation and tests are not just a box to check so that the process can move forward.
It is an integral part of software. Software with poor quality documentation and tests is worse
than software without documentation and tests, but both of these elements are a necessary
consideration for collaboration. As in, if you're writing code for yourself and you don't value
tests and documentation, no problem because its your own problem. However, if you're writing
code so that other people can use it, it is detrimental to submit code with no or poor quality
tests and documentation. This detracts from the project, adds noise to the code, and overall
increases the barrier to entry and understanding for the entire software.

Consider how a change fits into the big picture. The typical process is to figure out a
way to "add code" to enable a feature. Instead, consider how to "incorporate code" to
enable a feature. Adding-to without considering the whole continuously expands the scope and size
of the code while increasing complexity, and this is unsustainable for future development and
maintenance efforts. Consider how to incorporate a feature into the
existing design or redesign the software to support both the current context and the
new feature.

Write a pull request so that it is easy to review. Make it plain what your changes are and
why they were necessary and better than before.

The general idea in software design is to create low level tools that you can use and reuse
again and again at the high level. You know you're doing things right when adding new
features involves writing very little new code and is mostly using existing code in new
ways. Thats not to say its easy, but at least you've given yourself the tools with
which to do your future work.

Whats the purpose of our software?
Who is the target audience?
How long do we expect it to be relevant?
- This should be part of the design process
- Periodically reconsider whether the recent work and planned work is in line with these expectations

**Require each project to develop a software engineering road map as well as a capabilities road map**

Establish a grading scheme for software projects in future years
- Tie the grading scheme to the technical report so that any areas of the grades can reference back to the best practices


**Reproducibility**

Talk about code reviews and what to consider when reviewing and proposing code.
- Reviews should be verbose and to the point
- Consider the big pictures: what do these changes add to the project? how is it better than before?
- Run the code! Try to break it. Really exercise the new code. It's not enough to simply read it.
